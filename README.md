## Project Brief
The brief for this project was to create a microservice flask application written in Python, deployed via Docker, which utilises Jenkins for continuous integration. 

## App Design
- Service One:

    The first service is a front end flask application that displays data from the other three services. It makes GET requests to service two and three, as well as a POST request to service four.

- Service Two:

    Service two is a random genre generator. There are five genres to choose from and one is selected completely at random and returned in response to an API call.

- Service Three:

    Service three is a random instrument generator. There are four instruments to choose from and one is selected completely at random and returned in response to an API call.

- Service Four:

    When service one makes a post request to this service it recieves the genre and instrument generated by services two and three, and then uses some back end logic to find and return a video of song that incorporates both the recieved genre and instrument.
